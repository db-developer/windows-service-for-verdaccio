## frameworks ##

### [grunt](https://gruntjs.com "Homepage of grunt") ###

A framework for getting tasks done. Tasks can be testing, building, packaging, whatever.

### [eslint](https://eslint.org/) ###

Find Problems  
ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. ESLint is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.  

Fix Automatically  
Many problems ESLint finds can be automatically fixed. ESLint fixes are syntax-aware so you won't experience errors introduced by traditional find-and-replace algorithms.  

Customize  
Preprocess code, use custom parsers, and write your own rules that work alongside ESLint's built-in rules. You can customize ESLint to work exactly the way you need it for your project.
